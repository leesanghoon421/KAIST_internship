This project is part of AILEE 2025 - City Sensing AI projects v2

This project is divided into four main stages:

1. Building Detection

2. Distance Prediction to Buildings
3. Calculation of Building GPS Coordinates Using Vehicle GPS Information and Distance Data
4. Providing Detailed Information on Buildings by Connecting with GS1 GEO Data
